We have a large belt sander, Oscillating, narrow belt sander, and disc sanders, as well as hand sanders.

Make sure all guards are in place and operating correctly.
o Avoid distraction.
o Be certain the belt and disc are correctly mounted. The belt must track in the center of drums and platen. Do not operate the disc sander if the abrasive paper is loose.
o Disconnect the electrical power to the sander when changing the belt or disc or making major adjustments.
o Small and/or irregular-shaped pieces should be held in a hand screw clamp or a special jig or fixture.
o When sanding the end grain of narrow pieces on a belt sander, always support the work against the table.
o If the sanding disc rotates in a counterclockwise direction, position the material to be sanded from the center of the disc to the left edge. If positioned in this manner the sanding action will help to hold the stock down on the table. If the stock is positioned from the center of the disc to the right edge of the disc the sanding action will pick the edge of the stock up and created an unsafe condition.
o Do not reach across the sanding disc to turn the sander on or off. Your arm or hand may touch the edge of the rotating disc and cause a serious cut or entanglement. Move to the front of the sander and turn the machine off.
o Try to position yourself so that sanding dust will not be thrown toward the breathing zone.
o Hold stock steady as it is being sanded, but do not put so much pressure on the sanding disc or belt that the sander slows down.
o Keep the pieces moving along this surface so they will not burn.

Make sure to turn on Ventilation through the Dust Dogs whenever possible. If you smell sawdust or burning stop, evaluate and improve your air quality.
