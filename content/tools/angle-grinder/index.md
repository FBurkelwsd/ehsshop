An angle grinder, also known as a side grinder or disc grinder, is a handheld power tool used for grinding (abrasive cutting) and polishing.

## Usage

* Extra blades are in the robot cage usually or maybe on the shelf behind the band saws.
* Be sure to hold with two hands, check which way the cutting surface will spin.
* Ensure you have safety glasses on.
* May need to have an apron or long sleeves on depending on type of material.
* Make sure the sparks are not going to get into any piece of equipment and everyone around you is wearing personal protective equipment.
